# Knowledge-Driven Financial News Trading Agent

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
An AI agent that reads and interprets financial news in real-time, performs sentiment and entity analysis, and generates **trade signals**.  
The system integrates **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** and reinforcement learning for adaptive trading.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Process and analyze live financial news
- Extract **sentiment, entities, and market relevance**
- Use RL to convert signals into actionable trades
- Provide transparent reasoning for decisions

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (FinBERT, LLMs)
- **LangChain** (RAG pipelines)
- **Pinecone/Weaviate** (vector DB)
- **scikit-learn** (baseline ML models)
- **RLlib** (policy optimization)

## ðŸ§  Key AI Concepts
- Natural Language Processing (Transformer-based sentiment analysis)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Event-driven trading agents
- RL for decision-making under uncertainty

## ðŸ”‘ Implementation Steps
1. Collect financial news via API
2. Apply FinBERT for sentiment & entity extraction
3. Store embeddings in vector DB for semantic search
4. Train RL agent to act on sentiment signals
5. Integrate results into a trading simulator

## âš¡ Challenges
- Latency in real-time inference
- Avoiding overfitting to historical sentiment data
- Handling contradictory or noisy news

## ðŸ“Š Results (To Be Added)
- Accuracy of sentiment predictions
- Backtested trading performance
- Visualization of news-to-trade pipeline

## ðŸŒŸ Why This Project Stands Out
This project highlights:
- **NLP + Finance crossover**
- **LLM-driven reasoning**
- Ability to handle **real-time, high-stakes decision-making**
